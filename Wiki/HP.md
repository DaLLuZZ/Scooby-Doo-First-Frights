This section contains information related to HP values in the Scooby-Doo! First Frights game.<br />
In fact, the developers of the game called it "courage". But for our convenience, we will continue to call it "HP".<br />
<br />
Everyone knows that the player can see the character's current HP in the top corner of the screen (CourageBar or CourageMeter). Unfortunately, we do not have access to the knowledge of the exact values, we can only estimate it relative to the full bar. In fact, each of the playable characters in the game has a maximum of 100 HP.
